.. release:: Upcoming

    .. change:: new
        :tags: command-line

        Added :option:`--timeout <wiz --timeout>` to specify a time limit after
        which a graph resolve should be aborted to avoid the process hanging.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: command-line

        Added :option:`--init <wiz --init>` to specify initial environment
        variables, which will be extended by the resolved environment.
        For example, now it is possible to hand in a PATH or PYTHONPATH, without
        making them available in a definition.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: command-line

        Added :option:`--version <wiz --version>` to display the package
        version.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: command-line

        Added ``wiz edit`` sub-command to edit one or several definitions with
        the default editor or with operation option(s).

    .. change:: new
        :tags: command-line

        Updated ``wiz run`` sub-command to accept unknown arguments and
        automatically consider it as an extra argument which will be appended to
        the command.

        For instance, both of the following commands are valid::

            >>> wiz run python -- -c 'print("TEST")'
            >>> wiz run python -c 'print("TEST")'

    .. change:: new
        :tags: command-line

        Added :option:`wiz search --no-arch`,
        :option:`wiz list command --no-arch` and
        :option:`wiz list package --no-arch` options to display all definitions
        discovered, even when not compatible with the current system.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: definition

        Added optional :ref:`conditions <definition/conditions>` keyword to
        definition schema which can be used to indicate a list of packages
        which must be in the resolution graph for the package to be included.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: definition

        Added optional :ref:`namespace <definition/namespace>` keyword which
        can be used to provide a scope to a definition. It replaces the
        "group" keyword as it is also used to define where in the hierarchy of a
        :term:`VCS Registry` a definition will be installed.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: definition

        Added optional :ref:`install-root <definition/install_root>`
        keyword to definition schema to indicate the root of the install
        location of a package. The value set for this keyword can be referenced
        in the definition with :envvar:`INSTALL_ROOT` and should form the base
        of the :ref:`install-location <definition/install_location>` value.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :mod:`wiz.environ` module to regroup functions dealing with the
        environment mapping resolution. Added :mod:`wiz.environ.contains` to
        identify specific environment variable in string and
        :mod:`wiz.environ.substitute` to replace environment variables by their
        respective values in string.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :func:`wiz.utility.combine_command` to return command elements
        as a unified command string while keeping quoted elements in order
        to preserve the command in the log as it was typed.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :func:`wiz.graph.validate` to ensure that a :class:`Graph`
        instance does not contain any remaining error after the conflict
        resolution process. The :exc:`wiz.exception.WizError` error encapsulated
        in the nearest accessible node will be raised if necessary.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: command-line

        Updated :mod:`wiz.command_line` to use :mod:`click` instead of
        :mod:`argparse` in order to improve code maintainability.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: command-line

        Update command line arguments to use the same option
        :option:`--registry <wiz install --registry>` for installing to a
        :term:`Local Registry` and installing to a :term:`VCS Registry`.
        Previously the argument was split into `--registry-path` and
        `--registry-id`.

        Now definitions can be installed using the following commands syntax::

            # For local registries
            >>> wiz install foo.json --registry /path/to/registry
            >>> wiz install foo.json -r /path/to/registry

            # For VCS registries
            >>> wiz install foo.json -registry wiz://primary-registry
            >>> wiz install foo.json -r wiz://primary-registry

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: command-line

        Updated ``wiz search`` sub-command to also search packages using
        command aliases.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: command-line

        Updated sub-commands to only accept extra arguments for the ``wiz use``
        and ``wiz run`` sub-commands in order to execute a custom command
        within a resolved context. Previously, extra arguments were accepted by
        all sub-commands, which is not desired.

        For instance, extra arguments could be used as follow::

            wiz use python -- python -c 'print("TEST")'
            wiz run python -- -c 'print("TEST")'

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API, command-line

        Updated :func:`wiz.spawn.execute` to substitute environment variables
        within command elements before the execution process. User can then
        use environment variables in command, such as::

            >>> wiz use python -- echo \$PIP_CONFIG_FILE

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API, command-line

        Updated :func:`wiz.definition.fetch` to remove "requests" option which
        could filter definitions discovered. The filtering process has been
        moved to the command line in order to filter definitions from all
        systems as the definition mapping returned by
        :func:`wiz.definition.fetch` only records one definition per identifier
        and version.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API, command-line

        Removed ``--install-location`` option from ``wiz install`` subcommand
        and "install_location" argument from :func:`wiz.install_definitions` as
        this can already be set with the ``wiz edit`` command before installing,
        and just adds redundant complexity.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :func:`wiz.spawn.execute` to display a nicer error handling for
        the shell, when a command can not be found or executed. Now, when an
        :exc:`OSError` is detected, it will throw an error message instead of a
        traceback (A traceback is available if verbosity is set to 'debug').

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :func:`wiz.definition.discover` to add a "system_mapping" option
        which can filter out definitions :func:`invalid <wiz.system.validate>`
        with a system mapping.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Moved :func:`wiz.package.initiate_environ` to
        :func:`wiz.environ.initiate`.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Moved :func:`wiz.package.sanitise_environ_mapping` to
        :func:`wiz.environ.sanitise`.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :mod:`wiz.resolve_command` to return resolved list of elements
        composing the command from elements composing input command. It prevents
        unnecessary combination which could affect the nature of the command by
        removing single and double quotes.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :func:`wiz.package.initiate_environ` to add the
        :envvar:`HOSTNAME` environment variable into the initial environment.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :func:`wiz.definition.export` to sanitized the definition with
        :meth:`wiz.definition.Definition.sanitized` before exporting it.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :func:`wiz.definition.load` to add 'definition-location' keyword
        in mapping. Previously this would only be added by
        :func:`wiz.definition.discover`.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Added :func:`wiz.package.create` to instantiate a
        :class:`~wiz.package.Package` instance from a
        :class:`~wiz.definition.Definition` instance and variant identifier,
        and updated :class:`~wiz.package.Package` constructor to just take a
        mapping. This modification ensure that edition methods will work with
        packages (e.g. :meth:`~wiz.mapping.Mapping.set`,
        :meth:`~wiz.mapping.Mapping.remove`,...).

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Removed :func:`wiz.package.generate_identifier` and add
        :attr:`wiz.definition.Definition.version_identifier` property to get
        version identifiers from :class:`~wiz.definition.Definition` instance.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Added the following properties to get qualified identifiers from
        :class:`~wiz.definition.Definition` and :class:`~wiz.package.Package`
        instances:

        * :attr:`wiz.definition.Definition.qualified_identifier`
        * :attr:`wiz.definition.Definition.qualified_version_identifier`
        * :attr:`wiz.package.Package.qualified_identifier`

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :class:`wiz.graph.Resolver` and :class:`wiz.graph.Graph` to take
        conditions into account while resolving the graph.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :class:`wiz.graph.Resolver` and :class:`wiz.graph.Graph` to
        handle package extraction error so that it does not raise if faulty
        packages are not in resolved packages. If a package extraction error is
        raised for one combination of the graph, another graph combination will
        be fetched and the error will be raised only if it appears for all
        combinations.

        The package extraction error has now a lower priority, so that it will
        not be raised if a conflict error is raised before.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :meth:`graph.Graph.create_link` to not raise an error when a
        link is assigned twice between two nodes. This caused an issue when
        a package :ref:`implicitly required <definition/auto-use>` were also
        explicitly required. Instead, it now gives priority to the link with
        the lowest weight so it has the highest priority possible.

        .. note::

            If a package is required twice with two different requests, the
            first request only will be kept::

                # The following command will discard 'foo>2'
                wiz use foo foo>2

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :class:`wiz.resolve_context` to add an optional "timeout"
        argument in order to modify the default graph resolution time limit.

    .. change:: fixed

        Fixed :func:`wiz.graph.combined_requirements` to take requirements from
        all parent nodes into account. Previously it would use the distance
        mapping, which would automatically pick the node with the shortest path
        as the only parent to consider for requirements. That lead to the
        elimination of all requirement from other parents, so conflicts would
        not be properly detected and resolved within the graph.

    .. change:: fixed

        Fixed :func:`wiz.graph.updated_by_distance` to not filter out
        :attr:`root <wiz.graph.Graph.ROOT>` node.

    .. change:: fixed

        Changed :mod:`wiz.validator` to open the definition JSON schema once
        the module is loaded, rather than once per validation.
        Previously a "too many files opened" issue could be encountered when
        creating multiple definitions in parallel.

    .. change:: fixed

        Fixed :func:`wiz.registry.fetch` to resolve the absolute path of the
        registry in order to prevent the fetching process to fail with relative
        paths or trailing slashes.

.. release:: 1.2.1
    :date: 2018-10-24

    .. change:: fixed

        Fixed :func:`wiz.spawn.execute` to use the :func:`subprocess.call`
        convenience function which is less likely to leave remaining
        sub-processed when the parent is killed.

        This was an issue as the render farm is using :data:`signal.SIGKILL`
        to interrupt a job.

.. release:: 1.2.0
    :date: 2018-10-24

    .. change:: new
        :tags: command-line

        Added ``wiz install`` sub-command to install package definition to a
        registry.

        .. seealso:: :ref:`installing_definitions`

    .. change:: new
        :tags: definition

        Added optional :ref:`group <definition/namespace>` keyword to definition
        schema, which can be used to define where in the hierarchy of a
        :term:`VCS Registry` a definition will be installed (e.g. "python",
        "maya").

    .. change:: new
        :tags: definition

        Added optional :ref:`install-location <definition/install_location>`
        keyword to definition schema to indicate the location of a package
        data.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :func:`wiz.install_definitions_to_path` and
        :func:`wiz.install_definitions_to_vcs` to install one or several
        definition files to a :term:`Local Registry` or a :term:`VCS Registry`.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :func:`wiz.registry.install_to_path` and
        :func:`wiz.registry.install_to_vcs` to install a definition instance
        to a :term:`Local Registry` or a :term:`VCS Registry`.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :meth:`wiz.package.Package.localized_environ` to return
        environment mapping of a package which replace the
        :envvar:`INSTALL_LOCATION` environment variable by the
        :ref:`install-location <definition/install_location>` keyword value.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :meth:`wiz.definition.Definition.sanitized` to return a definition
        without keywords implemented when the definition is :func:`discovered
        <wiz.definition.discover>`. Only the keywords unrelated to the registry
        are preserved so that sanitized definition can be compared and
        installed.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :func:`wiz.utility.compute_label` to compute a unique label for
        a definition (e.g. "'foo' [0.1.0]").

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :func:`wiz.utility.compute_system_label` to compute a unique label
        for the :ref:`system <definition/system>` value of a definition (e.g.
        "linux : x86_64 : el >= 6, 7").

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :func:`wiz.utility.compute_file_name` to compute a unique
        :term:`JSON` file name for a definition (e.g. "foo-0.1.0.json").

    .. change:: new
        :tags: documentation

        Added :ref:`installing_definitions` section.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: documentation

        Added :ref:`tutorial/install/qip` section to tutorial.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: documentation

        Added :ref:`environment variable <environment_variables>` section to
        list and describe the environment variables used by Wiz.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: documentation

        Added :ref:`definition/install_location` to :ref:`definition` section.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: definition

        Renamed keyword 'origin' to 'definition-location', to be more consistent
        with the newly added 'install-location' keyword.

    .. change:: fixed

        Actually return a copy in :func:`wiz.definition._Variant.copy`.

.. release:: 1.1.1
    :date: 2018-10-23

    .. change:: fixed
        :tags: API

        Fixed :class:`wiz.definition._Variant` to ensure that it can be
        initiated with "\*args" and "\*\*kwargs" like its mother class
        :class:`wiz.mapping.Mapping`. The manipulation methods would not work
        otherwise as it attempted to create a new Variant instance without the
        "definition_identifier" argument.

.. release:: 1.1.0
    :date: 2018-10-23

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Moved manipulation methods :meth:`~wiz.definition.Definition.set`,
        :meth:`~wiz.definition.Definition.update`,
        :meth:`~wiz.definition.Definition.extend`,
        :meth:`~wiz.definition.Definition.insert`,
        :meth:`~wiz.definition.Definition.remove`,
        :meth:`~wiz.definition.Definition.remove_key`,
        :meth:`~wiz.definition.Definition.remove_index` to mother class
        :class:`wiz.mapping.Mapping` to ensure that logic is available in
        :class:`wiz.definition._Variant` object.

.. release:: 1.0.2
    :date: 2018-10-18

    .. change:: fixed

        Updated :mod:`wiz.command_line` to convert version to a string when
        freezing the environment. Previously it would fail with a type error.

.. release:: 1.0.1
    :date: 2018-09-24

    .. change:: fixed
        :tags: debug

        Fixed :func:`wiz.graph.Resolver` to store the extracted graph in the
        history mapping instead of the original one when recording the graph
        combination extraction action (identified with
        :data:`~wiz.symbol.GRAPH_COMBINATION_EXTRACTION_ACTION`).

.. release:: 1.0.0
    :date: 2018-09-05

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :func:`wiz.graph.generate_variant_combinations` to create a
        :term:`generator iterator` with all graph combinations from a list of
        conflicting variant groups. Implemented it within
        :class:`wiz.graph.Resolver` instance instead of dividing the graph with
        all possible combinations to optimize the resolution process.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :func:`wiz.graph.remove_node_and_relink` to remove a node from the
        graph and connect node's parents to other nodes with a new requirement.
        This logic was previously part of
        :meth:`wiz.graph.Resolver.resolve_conflicts`.

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :func:`wiz.graph.extract_parents` to extract existing parent node
        identifiers from a node.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :class:`wiz.graph.Resolver` and :class:`wiz.graph.Graph` to
        better handle graph division from variant groups added to the graph.
        Previously variant groups were simply identified during the package
        extraction process so a single variant could appear in several groups,
        which led to unnecessary graph divisions. Variant groups are now
        organized per definition identifier and updated for each package added
        to the graph when necessary.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :class:`wiz.graph.Graph` to record the number of times a node
        variant has been added to the graph and sort each variant group
        following two criteria: First by the number of occurrences of each node
        identifier in the graph and second by the variant index defined in the
        package definition. This will ensure that a variant called multiple
        times will have priority over the others during the graph division.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :class:`wiz.graph.Resolver` to better identify compatibility
        between package requirements during the conflict resolution process.
        Previously conflicting packages were compared with each other's
        requirement to ensure that at least one of them were matching both
        requirements. For instance:

        .. code-block:: none

            - 'foo==0.5.0' is required by 'foo<1';
            - 'foo==1.0.0' is required by 'foo';
            - The version '0.5.0' is matching both requirements;
            - Requirements 'foo<1' and 'foo' are seen as compatible.

        However, this strategy could not recognize when two conflicting packages
        had compatible requirements even when neither package versions could
        match both requirements:

        .. code-block:: none

            - 'foo==0.5.0' is required by 'foo<1';
            - 'foo==1.0.0' is required by 'foo!=0.5.0';
            - Versions '0.5.0' and '1.0.0' cannot match both requirements;
            - Requirements 'foo<1' and 'foo!=0.5.0' are seen as incompatible.

        The new strategy chosen is to directly attempt to :func:`extract
        <wiz.package.extract>` packages from the combination of both
        requirements so that an error could be raised according to the result.
        As a consequence, the latest example would not fail if a version
        'foo==0.2.0' can be fetched.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Renamed :func:`wiz.graph.compute_priority_mapping` to
        :func:`wiz.graph.compute_distance_mapping` to prevent confusion as a
        shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra's algorithm) is being used to define
        the "priorities" which are the shortest possible paths from nodes to the
        root of the graph.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Renamed :func:`wiz.graph.sorted_from_priority` to
        :func:`wiz.graph.updated_by_distance` for clarity.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Renamed :func:`wiz.graph.extract_conflicted_nodes` to
        :func:`wiz.graph.extract_conflicting_nodes` for clarity.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Updated :class:`wiz.graph.Resolver` to keep track of updates in the
        graph during the conflict resolution process in order to compute a new
        distance mapping only when necessary.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Removed :func:`wiz.graph.validate_requirements` as this functionality
        is not necessary anymore.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Removed :func:`wiz.graph.extract_requirement` as this functionality
        is not necessary anymore.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Removed :meth:`wiz.graph.Graph.copy` as this functionality
        is not necessary anymore.

    .. change:: fixed

        Changed :class:`wiz.definition.Definition` to validate data mapping on

        :exc:`~wiz.exception.IncorrectDefinition`.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Changed :func:`wiz.export_definition` to take a data mapping instead of
        individually requesting each keyword.

        The "packages" argument which were used to pass a list of
        :class:`~wiz.package.Package` instances to indicate the requirements
        list is no longer necessary as the requirements list could directly be
        passed to the data mapping. This implies that the user no longer need to
        fetch the corresponding packages prior to export a definition.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        The :func:`wiz.export_bash_wrapper` and :func:`wiz.export_csh_wrapper`
        functions have been removed and replaced by an :func:`wiz.export_script`

.. release:: 0.9.2
    :date: 2018-04-30

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: logging

        Changed :func:`wiz.package.combine_command_mapping` to display a debug
        message instead of a warning message when a command from a package
        definition is being overridden in another package definition. As
        commands are being overridden for basically every usage (e.g. to add
        plugins to an application), this created confusion for the user.

.. release:: 0.9.1
    :date: 2018-04-27

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Changed :func:`wiz.discover_context` to add the resolved environment and

        package request corresponding to a command request.

    .. change:: new

    .. change:: new
        :tags: API

        Added :func:`wiz.utility.get_requirement` to build
        :class:`packaging.requirements.Requirement` instances while raising a
        :exc:`~wiz.exception.WizError` exception in case of failure.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: command-line

        Changed the ``wiz view`` sub-command to only display the full definition
        if the request is identified as a package definition. If the request is
        identified as a command, only the corresponding definition identifier is
        displayed.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Renamed :func:`wiz.query_definition` to :func:`wiz.fetch_definition`
        for consistency.

        To prevent confusion, it now returns definition instance from a
        package definition request only, not from a command request.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Renamed :func:`wiz.fetch_definitions` function to
        :func:`wiz.fetch_definition_mapping` for clarity.

        To keep track of the origin of the definitions fetched, the registry
        paths are now added as a "registries" keyword to the mapping returned.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Renamed :func:`wiz.query_current_context` function to
        :func:`wiz.discover_context` for clarity.

        To prevent incorrect packages to be fetched from different registries,
        the original registry list is now stored in a :envvar:`WIZ_CONTEXT`
        environment variable along with the package identifiers so that a valid
        definition mapping could be fetched internally.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Renamed :func:`wiz.resolve_package_context` function to
        :func:`wiz.resolve_context` for consistency.

        To prevent incorrect packages to be fetched from different registries
        when discovering the context from a resolved environment, the encoded
        package identifiers are now stored in a :envvar:`WIZ_CONTEXT`
        environment variable along with the registry list.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: API

        Removed :func:`wiz.resolve_command_context` for consistency as the
        context should be only retrievable with a package request.

    .. change:: fixed
        :tags: API

        Added packages list to the context mapping retrieved by the

        :tags: documentation

        Added :ref:`tutorial` section to documentation, including a guide for
        :ref:`tutorial/project`, as well as some introduction into
        :ref:`registry` and :ref:`definition`.
        Additonal :ref:`guidelines` and :ref:`tools` sections have been added to

    .. change:: fixed
        :tags: command-line

        Fixed :func:`wiz.command_line.main` to correctly launch a command within

    .. change:: fixed
        :tags: resolver

        When a node was removed from the graph due to a requirement conflict
        which prioritize another version of the same package identifier, the
        link was not re-assigned to the correct node. This could lead to
        an incorrect priority mapping computation which would alter the package
        order resolution.

        Changed :meth:`wiz.graph.Resolver.resolve_conflicts` to update the link
        when a conflicted node is removed.

.. release:: 0.6.0
    :date: 2018-04-18

    .. change:: fixed
        :tags: registry

        Changed :func:`wiz.registry.fetch` to return the registry folders is the
        correct order so that package definitions from the secondary registry h
        ave priority order package definitions from the primary registry.

.. release:: 0.5.0

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: command-line

        Moved :option:`--definition-search-paths <wiz --definition-search-paths>`,

        sub-commands.

.. release:: 0.4.0
    :date: 2018-04-17

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: registry

        Changed :func:`wiz.registry.get_defaults` to return two global registry
        folders instead of one: The "primary" registry would store all vanilla
        package definitions and the "secondary" one would store all package
        combinations that need to be available globally.

.. release:: 0.3.0
    :date: 2018-04-16

    .. change:: new
        :tags: debug

        Added :mod:`wiz.history` to let the user record a compressed file
        with all necessary information about the API calls executed and the
        context in which it was executed (wiz version, username, hostname, time,
        timezone,...).

        :func:`wiz.history.record_action` is called within precise functions
        with a clear action identifier and relevant arguments to record all
        major steps of the graph resolution process (including errors).

    .. change:: new
        :tags: command-line, debug

        Added :option:`--record <wiz --record>` command line option to export a
        dump file with :mod:`recorded history <wiz.history>`.

    .. change:: changed
        :tags: debug

        Changed :meth:`wiz.graph.Resolver.compute_packages` to traverse package
        requirements in `Breadth First Mode`_ in order to include packages with
        highest priority first in the graph. This allow for better error message
        (incorrect package with higher priority will fail before a less
        important one), and a more logical order for actions recorded in
        :mod:`recorded history <wiz.history>`.
